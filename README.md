# Fluent

> [Fluent][fluent] is a localization system designed to unleash the expressive power of the natural
  language.

This is a [Sublime Text 3][subl] package providing Fluent syntax highlighting as well as a couple
of completions.

## Installation

We’re not on the [Package Control][pc]’s default channel yet, but you can install manually.

```sh
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages # Linux.
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages # macOS.
cd "$APPDATA\Sublime Text 3\Packages" # Windows.
git clone https://github.com/SirNickolas/SublimeFluent Fluent
```

Be sure to clone into a directory named `Fluent`, not `SublimeFluent`. Otherwise, some features
will not work.
